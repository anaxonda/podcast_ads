All right. Good morning. Crystal Hickman. Today I've got Crystal Hickman based out of California who's a native B conservationist by all just researcher. You got a nice book that your publisher just sent me to coincidentally. Like it was in the mail when I got back after I actually made you. So at the so-called botanist symposium, which was a wonderful event. It was like, it was goddamn. It was nice. I wish we had something like that out here where it's just like a day of presentations on all these interesting subjects. Your photography is spectacular, which I'm going to have to ask you about, of course, because it's really, you know, good depth of field, macro photography. You know, you study native bees, which I'm always saying fuck the honey bees, because I don't where I live they're deadly. Like every feral bee colony encounter is going to be the school. A lot of hybrids that wouldn't go to African-ized hybrids that are extremely aggressive, you know, bread hybridized them Brazil. And also they just don't benefit anything. And I think it's got to be obnoxious for you too, because, you know, I'll tell people, I'm so used to people being plant blind. And I just live in a world where most of the dominant society isn't care about the living world, and just is kind of alienated from it. It's not even their fault. But when you mention bees, people always think of the honey bees, the honey bees. Oh, honey, they totally do. Yeah. By the way, you should start your own botanist symposium in Texas. I know. So maybe this is your thing to like, like, you're starting to start one. Yeah. I mean, it's it'd be an awesome thing. I mean, the thing is like, Texas botany is still so like, prem and proper in vanilla in many ways. Yeah. Yeah. Like, shirt tucked in at a nice, you know, dockers that like, very like, this like aspiring to be upbeat. I don't know. I don't know. It's not as loose as in California. It's not like it's proud to like, you know, proud to have like be dirty, have been out in the field. Been scuffed up. You know what I mean? It's a very like, a risk. It's got too much of that aristocratic shit and it's still. You know what? You should require like 20% of like, verbi should be swearing. And then maybe that'll just like filter out some people. Show us your scars. Like show us where you've bled from falling on the lines, though, or having your flesh torn open by Senegalia. You know? Exactly. Yes. That's required. And I think you would make an amazing symposium. Yeah. And you're not allowed to tuck your shirt in, right? No matter what. Exactly. Unless you want to do that. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's weird out here. Texas is a whole other world as I'm sure you're aware. But yeah. But anyway. So this, but so the, the honeybees thing is frustrating is how, but like this, this book shows that there's, so it's called ABCs of California's native bees. And it's, you know, every different letters, a different species, you know, from Melisotis Agilis mega Kylie Brown eye, et cetera. You know, so this, I mean, it shows that there's so much more diversity. And this is probably such a drop in the bucket in terms of the diversity of the. Oh, it's, yeah. Seriously, it is. Because there's, there's a little over 1600 species. Like somewhat, my friend actually counted Olivia Messing of Carol. She got to 643 species. And it's just, yeah, I picked 26 of them. But there's even a DM of book that is undiscried. So there's, there's still undiscried species in California and the rest of the world as well. So there's an end. Yes. It's like these, these things are there. The way I view it, their pieces to this living machine. And you need all the pieces for the machine, the functions million. There's still stuff that we don't, we don't know that humans haven't, you know, bothered taking a close look at. Oh, yeah. Definitely. And I was surprised. The highest diversity, it's Sam Drake. He said this, too, with the presentation. But the highest diversity of bees is in the deserts. Is that true? And if so why? Yeah. Yeah. So in California, at least the highest biodiversity is in Riverside County and San Diego County. And I just think it's, it's tied to the plant diversity, which is just incredible. There's plants that you see in the desert that are nowhere else in the world. And a lot of the bees, like if you actually visit the desert, you'll notice that there's a lot more symbiotic relationships than there are in other places as well. So these, these bees can't live anywhere else because they need the pollen from that specific plant. Yeah. And it's just, the desert plants are just some of them are so weird, but just so interesting. I thought I'm always blown away because needing pollen from a specific plant, oligolecty, is I wasn't even really aware that was a thing until like a couple years ago. You know, like there's certain bees that can only eat the pollen of a certain family or genus. I mean, that level of specialization, you know, is wild. I guess in deserts especially, it's so extreme. It's such an extreme climate. You've kind of got to have these mutualisms. But I just, yeah, I was just, I was just kind of a standard to find out that in where it's tougher for plants to survive, you know, as opposed to like the music, higher rainfall, east, there's more native beat of diversity. Yeah. Yeah. And it's really interesting too because a lot of times like people say like the plants and the bees evolved along. I've each other, which they did, but really the bees evolved to suit the plants' needs. So that's why sometimes you just see features on these bees or behaviors that are just so unique. You could tell they just basically were designed to fit these plants, like the TV, for example. It has a relationship with this ghost flower. The ghost flower basically, but the back end of it, it looks like the back end of a female bee. So a male flies in there, tries to mate with the bee and ends up getting a bunch of pollen deposited on its backs. So every time it tries to mate with this flower, it just all needs it. Ghost flower, would it, would ghost flowers Moha via, or would it, would they change it to natural antirine? I think I think that's still the genus. Yeah. Yeah. You know, what was actually funny about that one? Like people were debating what the genus was. So I put both names in the book because I could not figure out what it was. Yeah. That was really annoying. I left. I mean, I moved out of California for five years ago. Just, I mean, I just kind of moved. I had men moving at Texas for families. My daughters grandparents were here, but I mean, I still, I learned botany in the deserts. I really got into botany in the deserts. And I just, you know, was so cool being back there and seeing all that. You know, it's such a different desert too. This Texas is where, you know, you see on the hundredth wordy in that kind of starts the dry out as you move west. But, you know, and you'll see, like, the same genera and families in some genera, you see here that you won't see in California at all. But, which is different species. Like different species in the same genus for the same family, but just wild variations on them. And, you know, the California deserts, I mean, there's so much drier. Like four to five inches of rain a year. It's nuts. Like out here, it's like we get 20 inches of rain. Yeah, it's, it's, it's an orange desert is, is higher rainfall too. You know, it can be really lush during those summer months soon. But anyway, but yeah, Moja, Moja, Moja via conferred a flora. It's an annual, and it's in plain tagin' AC. Just for a refresher for anybody who doesn't know out there. As well as for my own ass, because I haven't seen this plant in four years. But it's, yeah, and it's adapted a more folly resembling the flower meant Zelia in Volu Crata, which is in lowest season. I remember that, too. That's wild. So anyway, so the ghost flower has a specialist B pollinator, Moja via does. It does. It's called a zero-electus B, and there's, there's only two species in that genus. So yeah, I picked the TV for the book, and it's funny, because they like, they almost look identical to B's. The only way you can tell them apart is by like flipping them over and looking at the underside or by location. Is this, let me send a look at that, zero-electus Timberlake EI? Timberlake? Who's Timberlake? It's named after the Popstar, the teen. I mean, you could think it's Justin Timberlake, but yeah, there's also Timberlake. Is a very, very famous neurologologist who has his name just attached to so many different B's and discoveries. Was he based out of California then, I guess? You know what, I'm actually not sure where he's based out of, because you could go all over the US and see Timberlake B's. Yeah, so it's him or like you see like missionaries, well, I've seen missionaries name just pop up all over the world, which is crazy. So I'm just actually sure where they're based out of. You've got scales in the book too, like a scale in centimeters, but that's amazing shit. I didn't see, oh yeah, there's so much money. Yeah, you know what's funny too. So I, anything that's under three centimeters, I use the metric system, but when I'm talking to a lot of people who are just like most people. I talk to our American and they're like imperial, so if I go 16 to open inch, I started using M&Ms for size reference. And everyone, it just helps everyone knows like, oh, this B is half an M&M and everyone just knows how big it is. So you've got to break it down to a level that people understand, like if I was talking to my five or all that would say that, that'd be like, it's a size of an M&M, she'd be like, oh yeah, I get it. I mean, it works with 30 year olds too, so yeah. What is, what is, I want to ask you about the genus centers too, because that's a gene, that's a B that supposedly pollinates one of my favorite plants, Chromarian, but before we get into that, what are the diagnostic factors you use to identify B's? Like if someone's looking, if they get a really nice macroship, they don't know where to start, in terms of identification, what would you look at? Yeah, so people get B's wasps and flies confused a lot. I would say the easiest thing to tell is if you look at the antenna length, so if they have short antenna, it's a fly. If they have really large eyes that take up most of their head, that's a fly. There's very few exceptions in the B world, and that's just with male honey B's. Also the wing count, so B's and wasps have four wings, flies have two. Also on the side of a flies body, there's this little thing called like a halter, which looks like a bowling pin, basically. It takes place in the position where the second wing normally be. And then B's and wasps, the they nation, is a really good way to tell them in part, wasps and things that go to the tips of their wings. Also the behaviors are really.

So I would look at if it's collecting other insects like thrips or spiders or caterpillars. Things like that, that's something that being don't do. So these are technically like vegetarian wasps. But whilst we're meeting, they'd be eating thrips and other insects. They're collecting other small insects. Yes, so they collect them a lot of times or they hang out in a colony of ants. Like if you see a little like be or wasp looking insect hanging out in the colony, they'll do something called overpositing. So we'll stick a little egg in the body of like a thrips or a scale, something like that. That's not something that bees do. Also look for pollen collecting structures on these. So females have those. They'll either have them on their back legs, just like kind of fluffy hairy pants or on the underside of their appenons. That's not something that wasps have either. There's also something called a ocular sinus, which is and in it. Basically kind of looks like the shape of your thumb in the front of a wasps eye and bees don't have that. ocular sinus, okay. I'm writing this stuff down. But so that's the thing that's nice about wasps is I think all of them are predatory, right? No, there's some pollen or flower wasps that aren't. There's there's gold wasps too, huh? There are gold wasps, yeah. Yeah, I love gold wasps. Yeah, obviously I'm not. I'm not the person to consult on this. But I do have an interest and I am listening. But I mean, a lot of wasps are predatory and that's why you use them for bio controls. Exactly. And I thought it was like a small, there was a tiny wasp by fond of my yard, like a little red thing. And it was on, I think it was on a croton. But it didn't have a stinger. I mean, it looked like a wasp, like a tiny version. It didn't look like obviously one of the wasps that would sting you. And then I put it on an eye net and looked it up and I was like, oh, this is like a tiny red parasitoid wasp. This is dope. I didn't, you know, this is obviously going to help keep, you know, white flies and other stuff under control. I mean, that's been one of the fun things about, you know, I live like right on the Mexican border. So it's basically the subtropics and and I get to, I mean, this is the life I get to see from this little ecosystem I've created. And it's very dense is incredible. Like my yard has become a classroom, like a learning lab basically. So it's dope. Every time I got a block, I can try to see different species of insects. You know, from glowing the dark click beetles to bioluminous. You have those. Oh, yeah, I get bioluminous and click beetles. There was a fucking torrential at my front, like right near my door last year. I don't know where she came from. I just saw this little hole up here and I was like, the fuck is in. I knew it wasn't like a mouse or anything. And then I saw her like excavating it and going back in and then coming out and I was like, that's amazing. Man, no way. Yeah, one of those big Texas torrentiales. You know, and then I don't know what happened to her if something ended up getting her or what. But um, but uh, yeah, I mean, I was so stoked to have her. And then we get these little trap door spiders to that can, like I said. There's some of my favorite. That can live for like a decade. I didn't know that. You can live for a decade. They build that little, you know, it looks like a, to be crass. It looks like a used condom in the ground. Like I excavated one by accident. I was like, oh, what is this? And then I could feel the weight at the bottom. And I was like, oh, I know what this is. And it had the little, you know, hinged door at the top. And I was like, this is, I mean, I put it back and I felt bad. But uh, yeah, I'm sure that's the condom. A lot of people would like to use. Oh, yeah. But it's cool because then, you know, you'll see the tarantula hawks going around looking for them. And it's uh, it's remarkable. I definitely paid a lot more attention to insects now than I used to. So yeah, no, I think it's amazing. You're like, what you've created in your yard? Because like, with me personally, I live in an apartment. So I have to travel for nature. And I think it's amazing when people create these ecosystems in their yard. And nature is just literally right outside your door. Oh, yeah. And I think what people should be inspired by that. And it comes back so quick too, man. You can take like the bleakest, the bleakest urban area and plant like a native plant. Like you need like, you know, a good amount like a vacant lot or subsides of a vacant lot or something like that. And you plan native plants. And you know, even if you're like the bleakest area like concrete all around, some stuff is going to start coming back. And then as the years progress, more will come back, especially, you know, you think a lot of these, you realize a lot of these things are flying high overhead. And they're working down and they're going to go to the, if you're like the biggest, this density of green canopy, they're going to go right to their like a magnet. Exactly. Yeah, I call those native landscaping bridges. So when you have like something in your yard and just ecosystem, if they are seeking out new areas, just like encourage your neighbors to plant a small patch of native area. And it helps increase the diversity, genetic diversity of the insects. And also pollinators and more likely to find your yard as well. Yeah. And then all the cold birds and shit that, you know, utilize those things and eat those things. Okay, or pillars or whatever. Okay, well, go and back to identification. So if you're looking at like a, if you are looking, you know, it's a bee. And you know, it's not a stupid honey bee. How do you differentiate what I got to throw those jabs in there? And how do you differentiate? How would you start trying to figure out what genus it is? Yeah, so if you have a really good camera, I would look at the wing good nation. You can actually idea of the genus. Sometimes even species by these two little cells called some marginal cells on the wings. Sometimes they have to resells. Also head shape is a big thing. If it has like a head that shaped like a ball. A lot of times you could just tell that's a diet nature just by looking at the head. Also, sometimes they'll have different like facial features like a clip is which would be like a facial plate. That's a good way you could tell males or females because most females don't have that. Facial hair. They call them teeth on the mandibles. So if you look at the points, you can count how many there are. That's a good way to tell different species or genera. The little pinch like the little, the little like the face. Okay, but you would look at wing vination. That does that help with genus of B or just to make sure it's a B you're seeing. Oh, no, it's genus of B. There's so different. You can look at there's charts of different links. The top larger wing, the forewing. And you can look at that until it kind of be you're looking at. We got also. Really quick, really quick. Head shape wing vination sub marginal cells. Those are all good for identifying the genus and then what were you going to say? Um, you're also looking at their abdomen. So the way the hair lies on the abdomen. Running a business is hard enough. So I make it harder with a dozen different apps that don't talk to each other. One for sales. Another for inventory, a separate one for accounting. Before you know it, you're drowning in software instead of growing your business. This is where Odo comes in.

Some of them have hair in the middle of their band. So they have different segments on their abdomins that are called bands. And you can differentiate between genera by where that hair lies. Like some is in the middle, some is at the end, some is at the base. You can also tell them apart by where they have pollen collecting structures. So if they have them on their back legs or underneath their abdomen, some of them even have internal crops. So they don't actually have any external pollen collecting structures. So that's another way. This isn't, this is, okay, this is great. I got like fucking five of these key points. This is excellent. Thank you. Okay, so where did collect in the pollen? Where's the hair position on the abdomen? What's the head look like? What shape is it? Wing Venation and then this sub-marginal cells? The what are those exactly? Exactly. So those are the two cells, or two or three cells that are located on the four wings. Okay, two cells on a four wings. And what are the two or three cells? So they're shaped, they're all membership differently. Okay, well, we'll have to look it up on Google or something. You know, the listeners, the kids can look it up on the Google. Okay, this is great. Thank you so much. Okay, so we got, okay, so this is, this is exactly, because I've always wanted to ask, you know, what is a B, what is a B researcher called? What is it? What is it? A melatologist. Melatologist. Yeah. How do you spell that? M-E-L-I-T-T-O-L-O-G-I-S-T. Okay, dope, all right, thank you. All right. That's the M-E-L-I-T-T-O-L-O-G-I-S-T. Okay, you're like, I just take on the personality of like a, like a pre-C-N-I-L Italian man, it's just I can't wait to be old. I'm just gonna fight fucking, making them laugh. I have never done that, but I mean, okay. We've always, we've always, you know, I've got to roll the fill. It's some point that my life, I'm almost there. Okay, so anyway, so I go into the, the genus centrist. Is this true with the cramaria? With the cramaria flowers? Cramaria for those who don't know is a really cool, hemaparicitic plant that is in its own family. I guess it's closely related or more closely related to creosote than anything else. You might find in the deserts of southern California, but it's got these really cool flowers, and they're like hot pink with these, two of the petals have been turned into these, these oil-producing glands. So is it true what they say about centrist? The genus centrist of B. Yeah, so it's interesting because you'll actually find different species in the genus centrist going to specific flowers. But yeah, they love flowers with that they can collect oil from their oil collecting B's. So you could definitely find them on like the creosote as well. But yeah, that's true. Have you ever seen a different B cramaria? Or is it always centrist? I feel like I've seen a collides on there. Those are the heart shaped, like the bees with the heart shaped faces. And I think also, mega-c highly, but those are genderless pollinators. A lot of them. So they'll actually visit just a lot of different flowers. That's honeybee, as I think I've seen on them. Yeah. But they try and get on everything. I've seen honeybees on Embrosia, which is a coordinated plant. Yeah, like they're, I guess they're just collecting the pollen. I mean, it makes sense, I guess, but. Oh, that's interesting. Have you ever seen, how better the, how better the, the school, a lot of aggressive hybrid honeybees down there in Southern California? Do you see them? No, okay. Yeah, so, okay. Because I have lots of opinions about this. So some of them actually genetically tested all of the honeybees. And I think the Western United States, they're at UC San Diego. And every single honeybee they tested is a mix of multiple European sub-species and one African sub-species. So the African is the thing, the aggression, it's not really a thing. It's basically the aggression is if they're domesticated versus not domesticated. So a lot of times people will see these bees that, like, just resemble more so like the European ones. And they're aggressive, but they'll call them the Africanized ones. And it's, it's really just, if they're out in nature or not, because to survive, they have to be more aggressive. Yeah, that's, I think, you know, wherever the genes for aggression come from, it's, it's going to be filtered out. Like it's going to be more adaptive, you know, so. Yeah. Yeah. And you could just, they're down here. They're like stronger families. I mean, yeah. So instead of like, because yeah, I feel like the Africanized church, because it is really just like domesticated versus domesticated. So I feel like just the Africanized church. A lot of times it kind of has like a racial connotation to it as well. Really, they're the same species. Depending on who's using it. Yeah. Yeah. You're like fucking. Oh, sure. It was a term for super predators for like the early 90s late 80s. I remember. Oh, God. Fuckin' it. But, but down here, I mean, I've had friends get chased friends who are hurters or just even people. I mean, God damn, they'll come at you. Some of those aggressive colonies are just nuts, man. It's like, you know, you're not even near the hive. You're like a hundred feet away and still one. Oh, yeah. No. They can travel. Like, you could, I think the, the farthest anyone is seen around record is about two miles, like a two mile radius from a hive. Hmm. So they can travel. Where do you know where the, the, the quote, you know, African equal type of, A, it was an, it was an apisma liver. Is that the, the honeybee? Yeah. Yeah. Where, is it, where in Africa? Is it because Africa's a gigantic, I mean, it's like two United States. Yeah. Is it South Africa or, or Ecuador, or where? You know, I don't know where that one specifically comes from. But what's interesting is there's, uh, there's multiple subspecies in Africa. And the one that's in the US is only one of the nine. Um, but that's a really good question. Actually don't know where that specific subspecies comes from. Yeah. I mean, it's just, it's just ego types and different, you know, different habitats select for different traits. Obviously among, you could type some, and certain habitats that would pay to be more aggressive, especially if you've got, you know, bears or some other, some other mammal that's. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, could you know, anything about this is totally unrelated. Have you ever seen those videos from Southeast Asia of guys going up in trees? To, oh my gosh. Yeah. What the giant honey bees? Yes. I have. What species is that, you know? Oh, that's a good idea. Good question. I actually don't know what species it is. Um, I don't know. I just know there's giant honey bees. Yeah. I see this guy. He goes up like, you know, he's like 120 feet up and like the, a very tropical, for a very tropical looking forest, you know, and I can presumably these things aren't, I don't know if they're not staying him or what. It's wild. But, and then I've seen it. Yeah. Maybe they're used to it. To go on another, on related tangent, the, the, the stingless honey bees, like in central America. That's wild. I didn't even know that was a thing.
